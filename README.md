# Performance-Comparison-of-Cholesky-Decomposition-Method-Implementations
A study of the implementation of the Choleski method for the resolution of linear systems for sparse, symmetric and positive definite matrices. Comparison based on different open source programming environments and MATLAB implementation. Project for the Methods of Scientific Calculation course @ Unimib 18/19.
